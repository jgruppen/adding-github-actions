- GitHub account
- GitHub repository

# Recipe

### 1. Set up your GitHub repository
Create a new repository on GitHub or navigate to an existing repository where you want to add GitHub Actions.

### 2. Access the repository's Actions tab
Go to your repository on GitHub and click on the "Actions" tab at the top of the repository's page.

### 3. Choose a workflow template
On the Actions tab, you'll find a list of workflow templates. Choose a template that matches your requirements. For example, you can select the ".NET" template if your project is based on .Net project.

### 4. Configure the workflow file
Once you select a template, you'll be taken to the workflow file editor. Here, you can customize the workflow based on your needs.
Edit the YAML file to define the steps, triggers, and actions for your workflow. Each template provides a starting point, and you can modify it to fit your specific use case. For example, you can add steps to install dependencies, run tests, build your application, or deploy it to a specific environment. 

### 5. Commit and push the workflow file
After you finish configuring the workflow file, click on the "Start Commit" button or "Commit new file" button to commit the changes to your repository. Provide a commit message that describes the changes made to the workflow file and click on the "Commit" or "Commit new file" button to push the changes to your repository.

### 6. Validate the workflow
GitHub Actions will automatically validate your workflow file for syntax errors and configuration issues.
If any errors are found, GitHub will display them in the Actions tab, allowing you to fix them and recommit the changes.

### 7. View workflow runs and logs
Once the workflow file is committed and pushed to your repository, you can view the workflow runs and their corresponding logs on the Actions tab.
The workflows will be triggered based on the configured triggers (e.g., push events, pull requests) and will execute the defined steps.

### 8. Customize and expand the workflows
You can further customize and expand your workflows by adding additional steps, actions, and event triggers as needed.
Explore the GitHub Actions documentation and marketplace to find more actions and examples to enhance your workflows.
By following these steps, you can add GitHub Actions workflows to automate common tasks such as testing, building, and deploying code in your repository. Remember to review and test your workflows to ensure they meet your project requirements.
